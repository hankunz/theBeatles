	        <ol>
				<li>
				<p>The main navigation menu used to navigate between different web page is created with very user-friendly effects and colours. It's easy to find, read, and use. The main navigation menu also has sub menu for every pages, which can let users navigate to every areas of every pages easily.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>The side navigation bar is also created on the right side of the page. Users can always know which part of the page they are at, and they can go to different parts easily with very attractive effects without boring scrolling. Also, the side navigation bar also indicates the label of different parts from the pages. Users can not only clearly know which part they are at, but also go to any part of the page they want efficiently.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>The design of the website such as styles and colours are used consistently. Basically, three colours, which are black, white, and purple, are used. The colour and style of hyper linked text is also changed to be more user-friendly, and easy to identify. Images related to the topic are used to attract attention from users. The style and colour of font are used reasonably, for example, links all have same colour and paragraphs all have same colour.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>In terms of content, headings are all clear and descriptive. Transparent boxes are made to help reading if the background colour doesn't fit the font colour. The position of the content is limited to the centre which is considered to be the best area for reading website content. Emphasis and different tags such as Bold, Quote are used to draw attention from users.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>The content is divided into different parts depend on their meanings. For example, to explain the history, the best way which is used is to divide by time. After dividing based on the content, different parts are labelled to make it easy for user to get information. Long paragraphs are avoided or divided into smaller paragraphs. 
				</p>
				</li>

	        <h2 style = "border-bottom:2px solid rgb(171,31,75);padding-bottom:5px">The Reasons of Being Accessible Website Design</h2>
	        	        <ol>
				<li>
				<p>The load-time is reasonable with many different images. Most images are modified to have reasonable size without losing so many pixels, which can reduce the size of the website, and improve the load-time. Effects and plug-ins are used sparingly, which improved the accessibility a lot without slowing down the load-time. 
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>As mentioned above, two navigation menus are developed to make it easier for users to access different parts of different pages, and determine where they are.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>The use of colours and parallax background makes the elements distinguishable.
				
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>Web pages have different titles that describe its topic. Also, Section headings are used to organize the content.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>Media queries are used to make the website accessible in different size of screen. The navigation menus are made to be visible for all conditions no matter how to reduce the width of the window, which provides accessibility to all sites even if the size of the window is reduced.
				</p>
				</li>

			<div id = "content4">
	        <h2 style = "border-bottom:2px solid rgb(171,31,75);padding-bottom:5px">The Effects Used</h2>
	        <ol>
				<li>
				<p>An animated title bar is created for the main navigation by using Jquery and Css, which provides functionality of showing images. It also has sub menu for every pages. Users can navigate to
				all different areas of different pages as they want.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>The side bar is created for the navigation of each page by using Jquery and Css. Users can determines which part of the page they are at, and go to any parts as they want.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>The parallax scrolling is implemented by Jquery and Css, which provides different scrolling speed for different elements. It makes the elements on the pages distinguishable, and create a really attractive visual effect.
				</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<p>The scroll effect is implemented by using Jquery to make the scroll more smooth. It also improves the effect of parallax scrolling and side navigation bar.
